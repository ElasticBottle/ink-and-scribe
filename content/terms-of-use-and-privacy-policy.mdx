## Safe Route Refund Scheme

### Eligibility Criteria
The user shall be eligible for a partial refund of Ink and Scribe's professional fees pertaining to the assessment and filing of the trademark application in Singapore if the following criteria are met: The user successfully submitted and paid for his trademark application via the Safe Route filing scheme to file his trademark application in Singapore via the website. The user received a positive assessment report from Ink and Scribe for the same trademark application. For the avoidance of doubt, a positive assessment report is one that contains the following phrase in the title of the report: “Outcome of assessment: positive”. Upon receiving the assessment report, the user successfully submits and pays for the post-assessment trademark application within 3 business days. A refusal is received from the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) for the trademark application submitted. The quantum of the partial refund for eligible users shall be fixed at 100% of the fees for assessment and 70% of the professional fees for the post-assessment filing. Official fees paid to IPOS, bank charges, currency conversion fees and transaction fees that have been incurred by users shall not be refundable.

## Provision of Trademark Information
While we will do our best to ensure the accuracy of the data by only using official sources, such as data provided directly by the respective national IP offices, we cannot guarantee that the data will be accurate at all times and take no liability for any inaccuracies. Ink and Scribe is also not responsible for the availability of data updates that are provided via the respective national trademark offices, via APIs or otherwise. Trademark information made available through our services is for the user's convenience of managing his trademarks via Ink and Scribe's online services.
